# Passport Design

## Usage

The repo already contains the files you need to get started using Sass. But if you want to generate new Tailwind configuration files, you can run

```bash
npm run parse
```

`index.html` contains a dummy HTML file that is linked to the stylesheet produced by the Sass. You can start a `live-server` with

```bash
npm run start
```
