# Passport Design

This is a simple design system largely based on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

We use [include-media](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/include-media) for media queries.

## Usage

The repo already contains the files you need to get started using Sass. But if you want to generate new configuration files, you can run

```bash
npm run parse
```

`index.html` contains a dummy HTML file that is linked to the stylesheet produced by the Sass. You can start a `live-server` with

```
npm run start
```
